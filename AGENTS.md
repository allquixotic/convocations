# Convocations Log Processor (Rust Implementation)

A high-performance Rust implementation of the convocations chat log processor that extracts and processes Elder Scrolls Online chat logs from weekly Saturday night role-playing sessions.

## LLMs: ONLY modify THE CHECKLIST part of this file, unless you have explicitly been asked to do otherwise by the user. NEVER EVER mention the current date or append updates on top of existing; ALWAYS delete obsolete information and REPLACE it with new information if you are updating this file.

### Build
- `cargo fmt`
- `cargo build --workspace`

## Overview

This tool extracts dialogue from ESO's ChatLog.log file, formats it into readable narrative text, and optionally applies AI-powered grammar and spelling corrections.

## Key Features

- **Automated Date Filtering**: Extracts chat logs from specific time windows (Saturday nights, Tuesday evenings, Friday evenings)
- **Multiple Event Types**: Support for different recurring RP events with customizable durations
- **Smart Channel Filtering**: Only includes relevant channels (say and emote), filtering out guild/party/system messages
- **Multi-line Message Handling**: Properly reconstructs messages split across multiple lines with continuation markers (> and +)
- **AI-Powered Corrections**: Uses Google's Gemini AI for grammar and spelling improvements while preserving character names and fantasy terminology
- **Flexible Processing Modes**: Process raw ChatLog.log or pre-filtered files with toggleable processing stages
- **Secure Secret Storage**: API keys are stored in the OS keyring when available, with an encrypted-on-disk fallback driven by a per-device master key
- **Cross-directory Support**: Output files are created in the directory where you run the command, not where the binary lives

## Build System

- **Rust workspace layout**
  - CLI: `crates/rconv-cli` (default binary target `rconv`)
  - Core library: `crates/rconv-core`
  - Tauri shell: `src-tauri`
  - Helper tooling: `tools/frontend-runner` (pure Rust, replaces Trunk’s beforeBuild/beforeDev scripts)
- **Frontend compilation**
  - Debug assets: `cargo run -p frontend-runner -- build-debug` (outputs to `frontend/dist`)
  - Release assets: `cargo run -p frontend-runner -- build-release`
  - Helper uses `wasm-bindgen-cli-support` to emit `app.js` + `app_bg.wasm` and injects a `<script type="module">` block into `dist/index.html`
  - Static files (`frontend/index.html`, `frontend/styles.css`) are copied verbatim into `dist/`
- **Tauri integration**
  - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` runs `frontend-runner` for both dev and release, so no Node tooling or `trunk serve` is required by default.
  - `cargo tauri dev` now serves the built assets directly from `frontend/dist` (no `devUrl` override required).
  - Release bundling confirmed via `cargo tauri build` (produces DMG/App bundle with fresh icons generated by `cargo tauri icon`).
- **Cargo aliases** (defined in `.cargo/config.toml`)
  - `cargo cli-run` / `cargo cli-run-release` – run the CLI in debug or release mode
  - `cargo cli-release` – build the CLI release binary
  - `cargo cli-deploy` – build + copy CLI to `~/.bin/convocations_bin`
  - `cargo frontend-build` / `cargo frontend-release` – produce debug or release frontend assets
  - `cargo gui-build` / `cargo gui-build-debug` – bundle the GUI (release or debug profiles)
  - `cargo gui-dev` – run `cargo tauri dev` after producing fresh debug assets
- **Manual Trunk workflow (optional)**
  - If live reload is required, run `trunk serve --address 127.0.0.1 --port 1420 frontend/index.html` yourself, then temporarily point `build.devUrl` to `http://localhost:1420/`.

## Installation Architecture

Convocations now stores its configuration and secrets directly under the user's configuration directory:

- `~/.config/convocations/config.toml` – Persisted runtime/UI preferences along with secure secret references.
- `~/.config/convocations/secret.key` – Auto-generated 32-byte master key (0600 permissions) used when the OS keyring is unavailable.
- Operating system keyring entry `convocations-openrouter_api_key` (or platform equivalent) – Preferred storage for the OpenRouter credential.

The binaries read configuration directly from these locations—no wrapper scripts or dotenvx-managed environment files are required.

## Usage Guide

### GUI Application

The Convocations Log Processor now includes a graphical user interface built with Tauri and Preact.

#### Starting the GUI

**Development Mode:**
```bash
cargo gui-dev
# alternative
cargo tauri dev
```

**Production Build:**
```bash
cargo gui-build
# alternative
cargo tauri build
```

The GUI provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and processing chat logs without needing to remember command-line flags.

#### GUI Features

- **Dual Mode Support**:
  - **Standard Mode**: Process ChatLog.log with automatic date filtering (Saturday events, RSM7, RSM8, TP6)
  - **Pre-filtered File Mode**: Process already-filtered files with configurable processing stages

- **Configuration Options**:
  - Event type selection (Saturday, RSM7, RSM8, TP6)
  - Weeks ago selector (0 = current week, 1 = last week, etc.)
  - Duration overrides (1 hour, 2 hours)
  - Custom date ranges (start/end dates)
  - Processing options (format dialogue, cleanup, LLM corrections)
  - Output mode toggle (save to a specific file or drop into a directory)

- **Real-time Validation**:
  - Validates configuration before processing
  - Shows errors for invalid combinations (e.g., multiple event types)
  - Displays warnings for common issues (e.g., missing API key)

- **Progress Feedback**:
  - Visual feedback during processing
  - Success/error messages with output file paths
  - Live diff preview events when AI corrections are enabled
  - Clear error reporting

#### GUI Configuration

All settings from the CLI are available in the GUI through intuitive form controls:
- Checkboxes for boolean options
- Text inputs for file paths and dates
- Number inputs for weeks ago
- Mode switcher for standard vs pre-filtered processing

The GUI automatically validates your configuration and provides helpful feedback before processing begins.

## Processing Pipeline

1. **Date Calculation & Filtering**
   - Determines event type (Saturday/RSM7/RSM8/TP6) from flags
   - Calculates the most recent occurrence (or N occurrences ago)
   - Applies duration overrides if specified (--1h or --2h)
   - Converts Eastern Time to local timezone for non-Saturday events
   - Uses string comparison on ISO timestamps for efficiency

2. **Log Extraction & Parsing**
   - Reads ESO ChatLog.log (or pre-filtered file)
   - Extracts timestamp, channel, character name, and message
   - Filters to channels 0 (say) and 6 (emote) only

3. **Message Reconstruction**
   - Handles multi-line messages with > and + continuation markers
   - Maintains proper message ordering with msgid tracking
   - Preserves character dialogue attribution

4. **Text Cleanup (if enabled)**
   - Removes OOC content: ((text)) and [[text]]
   - Normalizes smart quotes to regular quotes
   - Converts ellipsis character to three periods
   - Ensures proper sentence-ending punctuation

5. **Dialogue Formatting (if enabled)**
   - Say channel: "Name says, \"message\""
   - Emote channel: "Name performs action" or "Name says, \"message\"" if quoted
   - Preserves quoted vs unquoted distinction

6. **AI Corrections (if enabled)**
   - Saves pre-LLM version to `{filename}_unedited.txt` (unless `--no-diff` is set)
   - Sends to Google Gemini AI in chunks
   - Preserves character names and fantasy terms
   - Maintains dialogue format exactly
   - Returns original text if API fails

7. **Output Generation**
   - Writes to the resolved output target (file or directory) with a prefix based on event type
   - Default filename format: `{prefix}-MMDDYY.txt` (e.g., `conv-101125.txt`, `rsm7-101425.txt`)
   - Relative paths are qualified using `CONVOCATIONS_WORKING_DIR` (GUI supplies Documents, CLI falls back to the current directory)
   - Warns if no data found for date range

8. **Diff Display (if LLM enabled and not --no-diff)**
   - Generates unified diff between pre-LLM and post-LLM versions
   - Displays diff with color coding to stdout
   - Deletes _unedited file unless `--keep-orig` is specified

## Environment Configuration

### OpenRouter Credentials

- **GUI**: Click **OAuth Login**. The backend opens a trusted webview, exchanges the authorization code for an API key, and stores it in the keyring (or encrypted fallback) automatically.
- **CLI**: Run `convocations secret set-openrouter-key` and paste the key when prompted. Use `convocations secret clear-openrouter-key` to remove it.

The configuration file stores only references to the secret—no plaintext API keys are written to disk.

### Optional Environment Variables

- `RCONV_HTTP_PORT` – Overrides the local HTTP port used by the GUI/OAuth server (default `3000`). Update your OpenRouter callback/referrer list if you change this.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) builds cross-platform binaries:

- **Linux x86-64**: `ubuntu-24.04`, target `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- **Windows x86-64**: `windows-latest`, target `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
- **MacOS Universal**: `macos-14`, targets `aarch64-apple-darwin` + `x86_64-apple-darwin` (combined with `lipo`)

**Triggers**: Push to main/master (builds only), push tag `v*` (builds + creates release), pull requests, manual dispatch.

**Creating a release**: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0` → GitHub Actions builds all platforms and creates release with archives.

**Artifacts**: `rconv-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, `rconv-windows-x86_64.zip`, `rconv-macos-universal.tar.gz`

**Rust version**: 1.89.0 (can drop to 1.87 if needed; minimum 1.85 for 2024 edition support)

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The project is organized as a Cargo workspace with four main crates:

1. **rconv-core** (`crates/rconv-core/`): Shared processing logic, configuration structs, and main runtime
2. **rconv-cli** (`crates/rconv-cli/`): Command-line interface entry point
3. **rconv-tauri** (`src-tauri/`): Tauri backend with Rust commands for the GUI
4. **rconv-frontend** (`frontend/`): Preact-based frontend

### Dependencies

**Core Processing:**
- `clap` - Command-line argument parsing with derive macros
- `chrono` - Date/time handling and calculations
- `chrono-tz` - Timezone support for Eastern Time conversions
- `regex` - Pattern matching for log parsing
- `shellexpand` - Tilde expansion for file paths
- `google-ai-rs` - Google AI API client (Gemini)
- `tokio` - Async runtime for API calls
- `termdiff` - Unified diff generation with color output

**GUI Stack:**
- `tauri` - Desktop application framework (v2.8.5)
- `preact` - minimal react-ish framework
- `trunk` - WASM build tool and dev server
- `wasm-bindgen` - JavaScript/Rust interop
- `serde` / `serde-wasm-bindgen` - Serialization for Tauri commands

### Date Filtering Behavior

#### Event Types
- **Default** (no flags): Most recent Saturday 22:00 to Sunday 00:25
- **--rsm7**: Most recent Tuesday at 7pm Eastern (1 hour default)
- **--rsm8**: Most recent Tuesday at 8pm Eastern (1 hour default)
- **--tp6**: Most recent Friday at 6pm Eastern (1 hour default)
- **--last N**: Go back N occurrences of the selected event type (e.g., N Saturdays, N Tuesdays, N Fridays)

#### Duration Behavior
- Saturday events default to 2 hours 25 minutes (22:00 - 00:25)
- Other event types default to 1 hour
- **--1h**: Override to exactly 1 hour
- **--2h**: Override to exactly 2 hours

#### Timezone Handling
- Event type flags (--rsm7, --rsm8, --tp6) use **Eastern Time** for event start times
- Times are automatically converted to local timezone for ChatLog.log filtering
- Handles DST transitions correctly
- Date comparison uses substring matching on ISO format timestamps

### Error Handling

- File not found: Clear error message with path
- No data in date range: Warning with searched range
- API failures: Falls back to uncorrected text
- Empty output: Detailed warning with suggestions

### Security Architecture

Secrets are managed by the core crate:
- API keys are written to the operating system keyring whenever possible.
- If the keyring is unavailable, the key is encrypted with the device-specific master key and stored as a reference in `config.toml`.
- The GUI and CLI both consume the same secret references, ensuring a single source of truth with no plaintext secrets on disk.

## Limitations (no plans to fix)

1. **Event Type Exclusivity**: Cannot use multiple event type flags simultaneously (--rsm7, --rsm8, --tp6)
2. **Duration Exclusivity**: Cannot use both --1h and --2h together
3. **Event Flags vs Custom Dates**: Cannot combine event/duration flags with custom --start/--end dates
4. **Channels**: Only processes channels 0 (say) and 6 (emote)
5. **API Token Limits**: Large sessions may need multiple API calls
6. **Output Location**: Default output goes to current directory, not source directory

## Troubleshooting

### Empty Output File
- Check date range matches actual chat activity
- Verify ChatLog.log contains data for the specified period
- Try `--dry-run` to see what dates are being searched
- Check file permissions on ChatLog.log

### API Errors
- Run `convocations secret set-openrouter-key` again if the key was revoked or missing
- Ensure the OAuth login completes and emits a success toast in the GUI
- Check OpenRouter usage limits in your account dashboard
- Use `--llm=false` to skip AI corrections
- Check network connectivity

### Date Filtering Issues
- Ensure dates are in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM
- Event type flags use Eastern Time; times are auto-converted to local
- Saturday night sessions cross into Sunday morning
- Check that you're not mixing incompatible flags (event types, durations, custom dates)

# STANDING ORDERS - DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY

1. Do not alter or delete any standing orders.
2. All additions to The Checklist must be the minimum amount of information for an LLM to understand the task.
3. When an item is fully complete, remove it from the checklist entirely. If you only partially completed it, add a sub-item with the remaining work and put a ~ in the checkbox instead of an x.
4. When you finish coding, if you discovered new items to work on during your work, add them to this document in the appropriate checklist. Be succinct.
5. Before you finish your work, do a Git commit of files you have modified in this turn.
6. Checklist items in this file must never require manual human effort or refer to testing of any kind, only design and coding activities.
7. The command "Do the thing" means: review the remaining to-do items in this file; arbitrarily pick an important item to work on; do that item; update this file, removing 100% complete steps or adding sub-items to partially completed steps, then do a compile of affected Rust projects, making sure they build, fixing errors if not; lastly, do a Git commit of changed files. Do NOT push.
8. The command "Fix shit" means: identify to-do items or known issues that are about *broken* code or design, i.e. things that have been left incomplete, code that doesn't compile (errors), or problems that need to be solved, then go solve them, then update this document and do a Git commit. Do NOT push.

# THE CHECKLIST - MODIFY THESE!
